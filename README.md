# MythLiveStream.bundle

Edit livestream.sh to match your setup.

Add livestream.sh as "System Event" "Recording started writing" to MythBackend

Install the .bundle the normal way.

Set the preferences for the Myth Service API URL as well as where you HLS stream is, in most cases this will be the same as the API URL. I put Apache in front of my stream so I could get to it from the Internet.
Now, every time a recording starts an HLS stream will be accessible from Plex.Edit livestream.sh to match your setup.
